    <p> <em>Seahorses </em> are awesome because they come in many different colors and they dont look like actual animals on earth. More of a fantasy animal in a storybook.<strong> seahorses do not have teeth or stomachs so the have to eat a lot to stay alive. Their eyes work independently of each other. To move up and down, seahorses adjust the volume of air in their swim bladders, which is an air pocket inside their bodies. </strong>.</p>
